# ROADMAP

## ABOUT
This tool analyzes the first 10 commits of a Git repository and creates ASCII diagrams showing classes and their communications (including states, props, serializers, function calls, and API calls). It also generates diffs between consecutive commits to track how the code structure evolves over time.
